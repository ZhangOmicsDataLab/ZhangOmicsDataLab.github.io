        <h1>Welcome to omicsDatalab</h1>
        <p>OmicsDataLab is a research team located at The James Hutton Institute (Invergowrie) that focuses on the
            development of novel and cutting-edge computational methods for high-throughput omics data. Our research
            includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Accurate and fast transcript quantification for
                alternative splicing analysis using RNA sequencing data.</li>
            <li>Improvement of protein and splice junction coverage
                in shotgun proteomics.</li>
            <li>Gene regulatory network inference using co-expression
                networks and large foundation models.</li>

                The method we developed to construct reference transcript datasets to enable extreme fast and accurate
                transcript/gene quantification using RNA-seq data in Arabidopsis is now translated into barley and potato
                and other 10 species, which improves the quality of the analysis results, reduces the analysis time. It
                provides great benefits for all the scientists working on molecular biology across the globe. Our "3D
                RNA-seq" attracted over 16K users globally since released in June 2019. It also won Best Innovation in
                Innovator of the Year Award at UoD School of Life Sciences Review 2018 and cited by over 70 papers published
                in high impact journals, such as Nature, Nature Comms, The Plant Cell. A spin-out SHARP Genomic Analytics is
                to be launched in March 2024 to commercialize our analytical platform, supported by InnovateUK, BBSRC,
                Scottish Enterprise and private investors.
