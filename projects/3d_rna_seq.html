            <h1>3D RNA-seq</h1>
            <p>It is web-based pipeline for the comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data from any organism. It represents an easy-to-use, flexible and powerful tool for analysis of both gene and transcript-level gene expression to identify differential gene/transcript expression, differential alternative splicing and differential transcript usage (3D) as well as isoform switching from RNA-seq data. The program is designed to be run by biologists with minimal bioinformatics experience (or by bioinformaticians) allowing lab scientists to analyse their RNA-seq data. It achieves this by operating through a user-friendly graphical interface which automates the data flow through the programs in the pipeline. The comprehensive analysis performed by 3D RNA-seq is extremely rapid and accurate, can handle complex experimental designs, allows user setting of statistical parameters, visualizes the results through graphics and tables, and generates publication quality figures such as heat-maps, expression profiles and GO enrichment plots.</p>
